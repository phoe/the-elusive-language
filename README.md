# Common Lisp: The Elusive Language

![Preview image](preview.png)

A small Common Lisp-related art project that I did back in 2017 and decided to upload here for posterity. And for viewing pleasure.

The [PDF file](the-elusive-language.pdf) contains all logos along with a bit of commentary from me. The [`png`](png/) folder contains (1000px)Â² versions of these images.
